# Sorting-Visualizer

 A sorting visualizer is a tool used to demonstrate various sorting algorithms in an interactive and visual manner. The sorting visualizer takes an array of data and displays it graphically, allowing users to observe the behavior of different sorting algorithms in real time. Users can select the sorting algorithm they want to visualize and adjust parameters such as the speed of the animation and the size of the input data. The primary purpose of a sorting visualizer is to help users understand how sorting algorithms work and how they can be optimized for different types of data. By watching the sorting process in action, users can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms and gain a deeper understanding of the trade-offs involved in designing efficient sorting algorithms. Sorting visualizers can be useful for a variety of applications, including educational purposes, software development, and algorithm optimization.
